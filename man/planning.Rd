\usage{
planning(materiality = NULL, min.precision = NULL, expected = 0,
         likelihood = c('poisson', 'binomial', 'hypergeometric'),
         conf.level = 0.95, N.units = NULL, by = 1, max = 5000,
         prior = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{materiality}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the performance materiality (i.e., the maximum tolerable misstatement) as a fraction of the total number of units in the population. Can be \code{NULL}, but \code{min.precision} should be specified in that case.}

\item{min.precision}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the minimum precision (i.e., upper bound minus most likely error) as a fraction of the total population size. Can be \code{NULL}, but \code{materiality} should be specified in that case.}

\item{expected}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the expected / tolerable errors in the sample relative to the total sample size, or a number (>= 1) specifying the expected / tolerable number of errors in the sample. It is advised to set this value conservatively to minimize the probability of the observed errors exceeding the expected errors, which would imply that insufficient work has been done in the end.}

\item{likelihood}{a character specifying the likelihood for the data. Possible options are \code{poisson} (default) for the Poisson likelihood, \code{binomial} for the binomial likelihood, or \code{hypergeometric} for the hypergeometric likelihood. See the details section for more information about the available likelihoods.}

\item{conf.level}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the confidence level.}

\item{N.units}{a numeric value larger than 0 specifying the total number of units in the population. Only used for the \code{hypergeometric} likelihood.}

\item{by}{an integer larger than 0 specifying the increment between possible sample sizes.}

\item{max}{an integer larger than 0 specifying the sample size at which the algorithm terminates.}

\item{prior}{a logical specifying whether to use a prior distribution, or an object of class \code{jfaPrior} or \code{jfaPosterior}. If \code{FALSE} (default), performs classical planning. If \code{TRUE}, performs Bayesian planning using a default conjugate prior.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{jfaPlanning} containing:

\item{conf.level}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the confidence level.}
\item{x}{a numeric value larger than, or equal to, 0 giving (the proportional sum of) the tolerable errors in the sample.}
\item{n}{an integer larger than 0 giving the minimal sample size.}
\item{ub}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the expected upper bound.}
\item{precision}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the expected precision.}
\item{p.value}{a numeric value giving the expected one-sided p-value.}
\item{K}{if \code{likelihood = 'hypergeometric'}, an integer larger than 0 giving the assumed population errors.}
\item{N.units}{an integer larger than 0 giving the number of units in the population (only returned if \code{N.units} is specified).}
\item{materiality}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the performance materiality if specified.}
\item{min.precision}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 giving the minimum precision if specified.}
\item{expected}{a numeric value larger than, or equal to, 0 giving the expected errors input.}
\item{likelihood}{a character indicating the likelihood.}
\item{errorType}{a character indicating whether the expected errors input type.}
\item{iterations}{an integer giving the number of iterations of the algorithm.}
\item{prior}{if a prior distribution is specified, an object of class \code{jfaPrior} that contains information about the prior distribution.}
\item{posterior}{if a prior distribution is specified, an object of class \code{jfaPosterior} that contains information about the expected posterior distribution.}

\description{
\code{planning()} is used to calculate a minimum sample size for audit samples. It allows specification of statistical requirements for the sample with respect to the performance materiality or the precision. \code{planning()} returns an object of class \code{jfaPlanning} which can be used with associated \code{summary()} and \code{plot()} methods.

For more details on how to use this function, see the package vignette:

\details{
This section elaborates on the available likelihoods and corresponding prior distributions for the \code{likelihood} argument.

\itemize{
 \item{\code{poisson}:          The Poisson distribution is an approximation of the binomial distribution. The Poisson distribution is defined as: \deqn{f(\theta, n) = \frac{\lambda^\theta e^{-\lambda}}{\theta!}} The conjugate \emph{gamma(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior has probability density function: \deqn{p(\theta; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha \theta^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta \theta}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}}}
 \item{\code{binomial}:         The binomial distribution is an approximation of the hypergeometric distribution. The binomial distribution is defined as: \deqn{f(\theta, n, x) = {n \choose x} \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{n - x}} The conjugate \emph{beta(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior has probability density function: \deqn{p(\theta; \alpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} \theta^{\alpha - 1} (1 - \theta)^{\beta - 1}}}
 \item{\code{hypergeometric}:   The hypergeometric distribution is defined as: \deqn{f(x, n, K, N) = \frac{{K \choose x} {N - K \choose n - x}}{{N \choose n}}} The conjugate \emph{beta-binomial(\eqn{\alpha, \beta})} prior (Dyer and Pierce, 1993) has probability mass function: \deqn{f(x, n, \alpha, \beta) = {n \choose x} \frac{B(x + \alpha, n - x + \beta)}{B(\alpha, \beta)}} }
