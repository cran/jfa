\usage{
selection(population, sampleSize, units = 'records', algorithm = 'random',
          bookValues = NULL, intervalStartingPoint = 1, ordered = TRUE, 
          ascending = TRUE, withReplacement = FALSE, seed = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{population}{a data frame containing the population of items the auditor wishes to sample from.}

\item{sampleSize}{an integer larger than 0 specifying the number of sampling units that need to be selected from the population. Can also be an object of class \code{jfaPlanning}.}

\item{units}{a character specifying the sampling units used. Possible options are \code{records} (default) for selection on the level of items or \code{mus} for selection on the level of monetary units.}

\item{algorithm}{a character specifying the sampling algorithm used. Possible options are \code{random} (default) for random sampling, \code{cell} for cell sampling, or \code{interval} for fixed interval sampling.}

\item{bookValues}{a character specifying the name of the column in the \code{population} that contains the book values of the items.}

\item{intervalStartingPoint}{if \code{algorithm = 'interval'}, an integer larger than 0 specifying the starting point of the algorithm.}

\item{ordered}{a logical specifying whether to first order the items in the \code{population} according to the value of their \code{bookValues}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{ascending}{if \code{ordered = TRUE}, a logical specifying whether to order the population \code{bookValues} from smallest to largest. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{withReplacement}{if \code{algorithm = 'random'}, a logical specifying whether sampling should be performed with replacement. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{seed}{if \code{algorithm = 'random'} or \code{algorithm = 'cell'}, an integer specifying a seed to reproduce results. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{jfaSelection} containing:

\item{population}{a data frame containing the input population.}
\item{sample}{a data frame containing the selected sample of items.}
\item{units}{a character indicating the sampling units that were used to create the selection.}
\item{algorithm}{a character indicating the the algorithm that was used to create the selection.}
\item{bookValues}{if \code{bookValues} is specified, a character indicating the name of the book value column.}

\description{
This function takes a data frame and performs statistical sampling according to one of three algorithms: random sampling, cell sampling, and fixed interval sampling. Sampling is done on the level of two possible sampling units: records or monetary units. The function returns an object of class \code{jfaSelection} which can be used with associated \code{print()} and a \code{plot()} methods.

For more details on how to use this function, see the package vignette:
\code{vignette('jfa', package = 'jfa')}
}
\details{
The first part of this section elaborates on the two possible options for the \code{units} argument:

\itemize{
 \item{\code{records}:     In record sampling each item in the population is seen as a sampling unit. An item of $5000 is therefore equally likely to be selected as an item of $500.}
 \item{\code{mus}:         In monetary unit sampling each monetary unit in the population is seen as a sampling unit. An item of $5000 is therefore ten times more likely to be selected as an item of $500.}
}

The second part of this section elaborates on the three possible options for the \code{algorithm} argument:

\itemize{
 \item{\code{random}:      In random sampling each sampling unit in the population is drawn with equal probability.}
 \item{\code{cell}:        In cell sampling the sampling units in the population are divided into a number (equal to the sample size) of intervals. From each interval one sampling unit is selected with equal probability.}
 \item{\code{interval}:    In fixed interval sampling the sampling units in the population are divided into a number (equal to the sample size) of intervals. From each interval one sampling unit is selected according to a fixed starting point (specified by \code{intervalStartingPoint}).}
}
}
\examples{
data('BuildIt')

# Draw a sample of 100 monetary units from the population using
# fixed interval monetary unit sampling
selection(population = BuildIt, sampleSize = 100, 
          algorithm = 'interval', units = 'mus', bookValues = 'bookValue')
