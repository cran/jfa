\usage{
selection(data, size, units = c('items', 'values'),
          method = c('interval', 'cell', 'random', 'sieve'), values = NULL,
          order = NULL, decreasing = FALSE, randomize = FALSE,
          replace = FALSE, start = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the population of items the auditor wishes to sample from.}

\item{size}{an integer larger than 0 specifying the number of sampling units that need to be selected from the population. Can also be an object of class \code{jfaPlanning}.}

\item{units}{a character specifying the sampling units used. Possible options are \code{items} (default) for selection on the level of items (rows) or \code{values} for selection on the level of monetary units.}

\item{method}{a character specifying the sampling algorithm used. Possible options are \code{interval} (default) for fixed interval sampling, \code{cell} for cell sampling, \code{random} for random sampling, or \code{sieve} for modified sieve sampling.}

\item{values}{a character specifying the name of a column in \code{data} containing the book values of the items.}

\item{order}{a character specifying the name of a column in \code{data} containing the ranks of the items. The items in the \code{data} are ordered according to these values in the order indicated by \code{decreasing}.}

\item{decreasing}{if \code{order} is specified, a logical specifying whether to order the items from smallest to largest. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{randomize}{a logical specifying whether the items in the data should be randomly shuffled before selection. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Note that specifying if \code{randomize = TRUE} overrules \code{order}.}

\item{replace}{if \code{method = 'random'}, a logical specifying whether sampling should be performed with replacement. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{start}{if \code{method = 'interval'}, an integer larger than 0 specifying the starting point of the algorithm.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{jfaSelection} containing:

\item{data}{a data frame containing the input data.}
\item{sample}{a data frame containing the selected sample of items.}
\item{n.req}{an integer indicating the requested sample size.}
\item{n.units}{an integer indicating the total number of obtained sampling units.}
\item{n.items}{an integer indicating the total number of obtained sample items.}
\item{N.units}{an integer indicating the total number of sampling units in the population.}
\item{N.items}{an integer indicating the total number of items in the population.}
\item{interval}{if \code{method = 'interval'}, a numeric value indicating the size of the selection interval.}
\item{units}{a character indicating the sampling units that were used to create the selection.}
\item{method}{a character indicating the the algorithm that was used to create the selection.}
\item{values}{if \code{values} is specified, a character indicating the name of the book value column.}
\item{start}{if \code{method = 'interval'}, an integer indicating the starting point in the interval.}
\item{data.name}{a character string giving the name of the data.}

\description{
This function takes a data frame and performs statistical selection according to one of four algorithms: fixed interval sampling, cell sampling, random sampling, and modified sieve sampling. Selection is done on the level of two possible sampling units: items (records / rows) or monetary units. The function returns an object of class \code{jfaSelection} which can be used with associated \code{summary()} and a \code{plot()} methods.

For more details on how to use this function, see the package vignette:
\code{vignette('jfa', package = 'jfa')}

\details{
The first part of this section elaborates on the two possible options for the \code{units} argument:

\itemize{
 \item{\code{items}:     In record sampling each item in the population is seen as a sampling unit. An item of $5000 is therefore equally likely to be selected as an item of $500.}
 \item{\code{values}:    In monetary unit sampling each monetary unit in the population is seen as a sampling unit. An item of $5000 is therefore ten times more likely to be selected as an item of $500.}
}

The second part of this section elaborates on the four possible options for the \code{method} argument:

\itemize{
 \item{\code{interval}:    In fixed interval sampling the sampling units in the population are divided into a number (equal to the sample size) of intervals. From each interval one sampling unit is selected according to a fixed starting point (specified by \code{start}).}
 \item{\code{cell}:        In cell sampling the sampling units in the population are divided into a number (equal to the sample size) of intervals. From each interval one sampling unit is selected with equal probability.}
 \item{\code{random}:      In random sampling each sampling unit in the population is drawn with equal probability.}
 \item{\code{sieve}:       In modified sieve sampling each item in the population is selected proportional to its value (Hoogduin, Hall, & Tsay, 2010).}
}

\examples{
data("BuildIt")

# Select 100 items using random sampling
selection(data = BuildIt, size = 100, method = "random")

# Select 150 monetary units using fixed interval sampling
selection(
  data = BuildIt, size = 150, units = "values",
  method = "interval", values = "bookValue"
)
