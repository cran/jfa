\title{jfa --- Bayesian and Classical Audit Sampling}
\description{

  \code{jfa} is an \R package for statistical audit sampling. The package provides functions for planning, 
  performing, evaluating, and reporting an audit sample. Specifically, these functions implement 
  standard audit sampling techniques for calculating sample sizes, selecting items from a population, 
  and evaluating the misstatement from a data sample or from summary statistics. Additionally, 
  the jfa package allows the user to create a prior probability distribution to perform Bayesian 
  audit sampling using these functions.
  
  The package is also implemented with a graphical user interface in the Audit module of 
  \href{https://jasp-stats.org}{JASP}, a free and open-source statistical software program.

  For documentation on \code{jfa} itself, including the manual and user guide
  for the package, worked examples, and other
  tutorial information visit the \href{https://koenderks.github.io/jfa/}{package website}.

\section{Reference tables}{
  Below you can find several links to reference tables that contain statistical sample sizes, upper limits, and Bayes factors. 
  These tables are created using the \code{planning()} and \code{evaluation()} functions provided in the package. See the 
  corresponding help files for more information about these functions and how to replicate this output.
