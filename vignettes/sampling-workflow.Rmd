## Introduction

This vignette aims to show how the **jfa** package facilitates auditors in the
standard audit sampling workflow (hereafter "audit workflow"). In this example
of the audit workflow, we will consider the case of BuildIt. BuildIt is a
fictional construction company in the United States that is being audited by
an external auditor for a fictional audit firm. At the end of the year, BuildIt
has provided a summary of its financial situation in the financial
statements. The objective of the auditor is to formulate an opinion about the
fairness BuildIt's financial statements.

The auditor needs to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence for the
hypothesis that the misstatement in the financial statements is lower than a
certain amount: the materiality. If the financial statements contain
misstatements that are considered material, this means that the errors in the
financial statements are large enough that they might influence the decision of
stakeholders relying on these financial statements. The performance materiality
is the materiality that applies to each of the populations on which the
financial statements are based. For this example, the performance materiality is
set at 5% of the total value of the population.

In this example, we focus on the `BuildIt` data set that comes with the **jfa**
package.

```{r}
data("BuildIt")
head(BuildIt)
```

The population of interest consists of 3500 items, each with a booked value.
Let's assume that, before performing audit sampling, the auditor has assessed
the quality of BuildIt's internal control systems and found that they were
working properly.

In order to formulate an opinion about the misstatement in the population, the
auditor separates their audit workflow into four stages. First, they will need
to plan the minimum size of a sample they need to inspect to perform inference
about the population. Second, they will need to select the required sample from
the population. Third, they will need to inspect the selected sample and
determine the audit (true) value of the items it contains. Fourth, they will
need to use the information from the inspected sample to perform inference about
the misstatement in the population.

## Setting up the audit

The auditor wants to make a statement that, with 95% confidence, the misstatement
in the population is lower than the performance materiality of 5%. Based on last
year's audit at BuildIt, where the upper bound of the misstatement turned out to
be 2.5%, they want to tolerate at most 2.5% errors in the intended sample. The
auditor can therefore re-formulate their statistical statement as that they want
to conclude that, when 2.5% errors are found in the sample, they can conclude
with 95% confidence that the misstatement in the population is lower than the
performance materiality of 5%.

Below, the auditor defines the performance materiality, confidence level, and
expected misstatements in the sample.

```{r}
# Specify the confidence, materiality, and expected errors.
confidence <- 0.95 # 95%
materiality <- 0.05 # 5%
expected <- 0.025 # 2.5%
```

Many audits are performed according to the *audit risk model (ARM)*, which
determines that the uncertainty about the auditor's statement as a whole
(1 - the confidence) is a factor of three terms: the inherent risk, the control
risk, and the detection risk. Inherent risk is the risk posed by an error in
BuildIt's financial statement that could be material, before consideration of
any related control systems (e.g., computer systems). Control risk is the risk
that a material misstatement is not prevented or detected by BuildIt's internal
control systems. Detection risk is the risk that the auditor will fail to find
material misstatements that exist in an BuildIt's financial statements. The
*ARM* is practically useful because for a given level of audit risk, the
tolerable detection risk bears an inverse relation to the other two risks. The
*ARM* is useful for the auditor because it enables them to incorporate existing
information on BuildIt's organization to increase the required risk that they
will fail to find a material misstatement.

$$ \text{Audit risk} = \text{Inherent risk} \,\times\, \text{Control risk} \,\times\, \text{Detection risk}$$

Usually the auditor judges inherent risk and control risk on a three-point scale
consisting of low, medium, and high. Different audit firms handle different
standard percentages for these categories. The auditor's firm defines the
probabilities of low, medium, and high respectively as 50%, 60%, and 100%.
Because the auditor assessed BuildIt's internal control systems, they assess the
control risk as medium (60%).

```{r}
# Specify the inherent risk (ir) and control risk (cr).
ir <- 1 # 100%
cr <- 0.6 # 60%
```

## Stage 1: Planning an audit sample

<p align='center'><img src='https://github.com/koenderks/jfa/raw/development/vignettes/img/planning.png' alt='planning' width='100%'></p>

The auditor can choose to either perform a frequentist analysis, where they use
the increased detection risk as their level of uncertainty, or perform a
Bayesian analysis, where they incorporate the information about the control risk
into a prior distribution. For this example, we will show how to perform a
Bayesian analysis. A frequentist analysis can easily be done through the
following functions by setting `prior = FALSE`. In a frequentist analysis, the
auditor immediately uses the adjusted confidence to calculate the sample size
via the `planning()` function.

```{r}
# Adjust the required confidence for a frequentist analysis.
c.adj <- 1 - ((1 - confidence) / (ir * cr))
# Step 1: Calculate the required sample size.
stage1 <- planning(materiality = materiality, expected = expected, conf.level = c.adj)
```

The auditor can then inspect the result from the planning procedure by using the
`summary()` function. The result shows that the auditor needs to select a sample
of 178 items so that, when at most 4.45 misstatements are found, they can
conclude with 91.66% confidence that the misstatement in BuildIt's population
is lower than the performance materiality of 5%. 

```{r}
summary(stage1)
```

## Stage 2: Selecting a sample

<p align='center'><img src='https://github.com/koenderks/jfa/raw/development/vignettes/img/selection.png' alt='selection' width='100%'></p>

The auditor is now ready to select the required 178 items from the population.
They can choose to do this according to one of two statistical methods. In
*record sampling* (`units = "items"`), inclusion probabilities are assigned on
the item level, treating item with a high value and a low value the same, an 
item of $5,000 is equally likely to be selected as an item of $1,000. In 
*monetary unit sampling* (`units = "values"`), inclusion probabilities are
assigned on the level of individual monetary units (e.g., a dollar). When a
dollar is selected to be in the sample, the item that includes that dollar is
selected. This favors items with a higher value, as an item with a value of 
\$5,000 is now five times more likely to be selected than an item with a value
of \$1,000.

The auditor chooses to use *monetary unit sampling*, as they wants to include
more high-valued items. The `selection()` function enables them to select the
sample from the population. She uses the `stage1` object as an input for the
`selection()` function, since this passes the calculated sample size to the
function.

```{r}
# Step 2: Draw a sample from the financial statements.
stage2 <- selection(data = BuildIt, size = stage1, units = "values", values = "bookValue", method = "interval")
```

Like before, the auditor can inspect the outcomes of their sampling procedure\
by using the `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(stage2)
```

## Stage 3: Executing the audit

The selected sample can be isolated by indexing the `sample` object from the
sampling result.

```{r}
# Step 3: Isolate the sample for execution of the audit.
sample <- stage2$sample
```

Next, the auditor can execute the audit by annotating the items in the sample
with their audit values (for exampling by writing the sample to a *.csv* file
using `write.csv()`. They can then load the annotated sample back into the R
session for further evaluation. For this example, the audit values of the sample
items are already included in the `auditValue` column of the data set.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# To write the sample to a .csv file:
write.csv(x = sample, file = "auditSample.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# To load annotated sample back into R:
sample <- read.csv(file = "auditSample.csv")
```

## Stage 4: Evaluating the sample

<p align='center'><img src='https://github.com/koenderks/jfa/raw/development/vignettes/img/evaluation.png' alt='evaluation' width='100%'></p>

Using the annotated sample, the auditor can perform inference about the
misstatement in the population via the `evaluation()` function.

```{r}
# Step 4: Evaluate the sample
stage4 <- evaluation(
  materiality = materiality, conf.level = c.adj, data = sample,
  values = "bookValue", values.audit = "auditValue"
)
```

The auditor can inspect the outcomes of her inference by using the `summary()`
function. The resulting 91.66% upper bound is 1.396%, which is lower than the
performance materiality of 5%.

```{r}
summary(stage4)
```

## Conclusion

Since the 91.66% upper confidence bound on the misstatement in population is
lower than the performance materiality, the auditor has obtained sufficient
evidence to conclude that the population does not contain material
misstatements. The auditor can create a `html` or `pdf` report of the statistical
results using the `report()` function, as shown below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
report(stage4, file = "report.html")
```
