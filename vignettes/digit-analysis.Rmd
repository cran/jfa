## Introduction

Welcome to the 'Digit analysis' vignette of the **jfa** package. In this
vignette you are able to find detailed examples of how you can incorporate the
`digit_test()` and `repeated_test()` functions provided by the package.

## Function: `digit_test()`

The function `digit_test()` takes a vector of numeric values, extract the
requested digits, and compares the frequencies of these digits to a reference
distribution. The function either performs a frequentist hypothesis test of the
null hypothesis that the digits are distributed according to the reference
distribution and produces a *p* value or a Bayesian hypothesis test of the null
hypothesis that the digits are distributed according to the reference
distribution against the alternative hypothesis (using the prior parameters
specified in `prior`) that the digits are not distributed according to the
reference distribution and produces a Bayes factor (Kass & Raftery, 1995).

*Example:*

Benfordâ€™s law (Benford, 1938) is a principle that describes a pattern in many
naturally-occurring numbers. According to Benford's law, each possible leading
digit *d* in a naturally occurring, or non-manipulated, set of numbers occurs
with a probability `p(d) = log10(1 + 1/d)`. The distribution of leading digits
in a data set of financial transaction values (e.g., the `sinoForest` data) can
be extracted and tested against the expected frequencies under Benford's law
using the code below.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
# Frequentist hypothesis test
x <- digit_test(sinoForest$value, check = "first", reference = "benford")
print(x)
plot(x)

# Bayesian hypothesis test using default prior
x <- digit_test(sinoForest$value, check = "first", reference = "benford", prior = TRUE)
print(x)
plot(x)
```

## Function: `repeated_test()`

The function `repeated_test()` analyzes the frequency with which values get
repeated within a set of numbers. Unlike Benford's law, and its generalizations,
this approach examines the entire number at once, not only the first or last
digit. For the technical details of this procedure, see Simohnsohn (2019).

*Example:*

In this example we analyze a data set from a (retracted) paper that describes
three experiments run in Chinese factories, where workers were nudged to use
more hand-sanitizer. These data were shown to exhibited two classic markers of
data tampering: impossibly similar means and the uneven distribution of last
digits (Yu, Nelson, & Simohnson, 2018). We can use the `repeated_test()`
function to test if these data also contain a greater amount of repeated values
than expected if the data were not tampered with.

```{r fig.align="center", fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
x <- repeated_test(sanitizer$value, check = "lasttwo", samples = 2000)
print(x)
plot(x)
```
